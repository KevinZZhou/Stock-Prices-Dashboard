# Stock-Market-Dashboard
 A dashboard that displays historical stock prices - Built with Plotly Dash

## Planning
2 columns in the dashboard: 
1. Describing the dashboard's purpose and providing a box/dropdown for user input (3/12)
2. Displaying the generated graph(s) (9/12)

The app will take user input and display a graph of historical closing prices for the user-specified stock.
If the user input is invalid, default to a preset stock.

Optional:
* Display more than one stock (multiple graphs, multiple lines, etc.)?
* Dropdown that gives a list of valid stock names based on letters typed?
* Stylesheet?
